# TrustedDevicesNFCFix
A simple Xposed module to fix NFC Trusted Devices lock screen feature on HTC M8 GPE ROM.

# Usage
Currently, you will need a copy of Android Studio to build this project. If you are reading this and really want an .apk you can install without doing the build yourself, please just open an issue. You will also need the Xposed framework on your phone.

# Credit
I ripped much of my code from [this repo](https://github.com/Nephiel/NFCLockScreenOffEnablerMM), but since that module did not work for me, I stripped out all the un-necessary code and only implemented the parts that I needed.
